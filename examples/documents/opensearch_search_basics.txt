OpenSearch and Elasticsearch Search Basics
1. OpenSearch and Elasticsearch are search and analytics engines.
2. Documents are stored in indices with mappings.
3. Mappings define field types such as text, keyword, and date.
4. Text fields are analyzed for full-text search.
5. Keyword fields are exact-match for filters and aggregations.
6. The inverted index powers fast search queries.
7. Analyzers tokenize text, remove stop words, and apply stemming.
8. Query DSL allows complex boolean queries.
9. Match queries are used for full-text search.
10. Term queries are used for exact matches.
11. Aggregations summarize data for analytics.
12. Index templates apply settings to new indices.
13. Shards divide data across nodes for scalability.
14. Replicas provide redundancy and higher read throughput.
15. Refresh intervals determine search visibility latency.
16. Bulk indexing improves ingestion performance.
17. The _bulk API accepts multiple operations in a single request.
18. Query results include a _score for relevance.
19. The BM25 algorithm is a common default scoring model.
20. Filters do not affect scoring but narrow result sets.
21. Highlighting returns snippets with query terms.
22. OpenSearch supports k-NN search for vector similarity.
23. Vector search powers semantic retrieval.
24. OpenSearch supports ingest pipelines for transformations.
25. Ingest pipelines can enrich documents at index time.
26. Index aliases simplify blue-green deployments.
27. Use index lifecycle management to manage retention.
28. Use snapshots for backups.
29. OpenSearch provides Dashboards for visualization.
30. The REST API supports JSON requests.
31. Security features include access control and audit logging.
32. Role-based access control defines index permissions.
33. Index settings include refresh and replica counts.
34. Search queries can combine must, should, and must_not clauses.
35. The term "document" refers to a JSON object stored in the index.
36. Search results include hits and total counts.
37. Sorting can be applied on keyword or numeric fields.
38. Pagination uses from/size parameters.
39. The scroll API supports deep pagination.
40. The search_after parameter supports efficient pagination.
41. OpenSearch supports geospatial queries.
42. Aggregations include terms, date_histogram, and metrics.
43. Indexing pipelines can parse structured content.
44. Multi-field mappings allow both text and keyword indexing.
45. The `_source` field stores original JSON.
46. Source filtering reduces payload sizes.
47. Query caches improve repeated query performance.
48. Fielddata enables aggregations on text fields.
49. Use doc_values for efficient sorting and aggregation.
50. Cluster health states include green, yellow, and red.
51. Shard allocation controls data distribution.
52. Hot-warm architectures separate indexing and storage.
53. Search templates allow parameterized queries.
54. Synonyms improve recall for search queries.
55. Stop words can be customized per analyzer.
56. Token filters customize text processing.
57. Custom analyzers combine tokenizers and filters.
58. OpenSearch supports alerting on query conditions.
59. The REST API supports `_search` and `_count` endpoints.
60. Use `_analyze` to test analyzers.
61. Use `_mapping` to view field mappings.
62. Performance tuning involves shard size and refresh rates.
63. Index shards should be sized for expected data growth.
64. Use circuit breakers to prevent memory issues.
65. OpenSearch supports cross-cluster search.
66. Cross-cluster replication supports DR strategies.
67. Use index aliases for zero-downtime reindexing.
68. Reindex API copies data across indices.
69. Use pipelines for data normalization.
70. Document IDs can be client-generated or auto-generated.
71. Delete-by-query removes documents based on filters.
72. OpenSearch can be used for log analytics.
73. Vector search in OpenSearch supports cosine similarity.
74. Use script scoring for custom ranking.
75. OpenSearch supports percolate queries for reverse search.
76. Search can be combined with filters for structured constraints.
77. Monitoring uses built-in metrics and dashboards.
78. Index statistics help tune query performance.
79. OpenSearch is commonly used for RAG retrieval.
80. Search quality depends on analyzer and content strategy.
