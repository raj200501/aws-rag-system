Amazon S3 Basics
1. Amazon S3 is an object storage service with high durability.
2. Buckets are global namespaces and hold objects.
3. Objects consist of data, metadata, and a key name.
4. S3 supports multiple storage classes, including Standard and Glacier.
5. Lifecycle policies transition objects between storage classes.
6. Versioning preserves old versions of objects.
7. Server-side encryption can be enabled with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.
8. S3 supports client-side encryption for additional control.
9. Bucket policies control access at the bucket level.
10. IAM policies control access at the identity level.
11. Access Control Lists are legacy and generally discouraged.
12. S3 integrates with CloudTrail for audit logs.
13. S3 provides event notifications via SNS, SQS, and Lambda.
14. S3 inventory produces CSV or ORC reports of objects.
15. S3 supports static website hosting.
16. S3 replication can copy objects across regions.
17. Replication supports same-region and cross-region modes.
18. Object Lock provides WORM retention.
19. S3 Block Public Access settings help prevent accidental exposure.
20. S3 supports multipart uploads for large objects.
21. Multipart uploads improve throughput and resilience.
22. S3 Select retrieves subsets of data from objects.
23. S3 Access Points simplify access for large-scale data.
24. S3 supports bucket-level metrics via CloudWatch.
25. S3 requesters can use requester-pays buckets.
26. S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency.
27. The maximum object size is 5 TB.
28. Part sizes for multipart uploads range from 5 MB to 5 GB.
29. S3 can host data lakes and analytics data.
30. S3 integrates with Athena for querying data.
31. S3 integrates with EMR and Glue for ETL.
32. Use pre-signed URLs for temporary access.
33. Bucket names must be DNS-compliant.
34. S3 supports object tags for classification.
35. Tags can be used in lifecycle rules and cost allocation.
36. S3 provides storage lens dashboards for usage insights.
37. S3 access logs capture requests to a bucket.
38. Use VPC endpoints to keep S3 traffic private.
39. S3 supports Transfer Acceleration for global uploads.
40. S3 is highly durable with 11 nines of durability.
41. S3 availability depends on the region and storage class.
42. S3 provides strong integration with AWS Lambda.
43. S3 can store model artifacts for machine learning.
44. S3 can store documents for RAG indexing.
45. S3 object metadata can include custom fields.
46. S3 prefix design impacts performance for large buckets.
47. Use intelligent tiering for unknown access patterns.
48. S3 Batch Operations perform large-scale updates.
49. Use S3 Object Lambda for transformations on read.
50. S3 supports object-level logging via CloudTrail.
51. S3 supports MFA delete for versioned buckets.
52. The AWS CLI can sync folders to S3.
53. S3 APIs include PUT, GET, LIST, and DELETE.
54. S3 supports event notifications with filters.
55. Use KMS keys to manage encryption independently.
56. Bucket policies can require TLS for requests.
57. Use S3 for backup and archival storage.
58. S3 supports access analytics for unused access.
59. S3 integrates with AWS Config for compliance.
60. S3 is region-specific but accessible globally.
61. S3 can store unstructured and structured data.
62. S3 supports object-level replication metrics.
63. Use S3 for static assets in web apps.
64. CloudFront can be used as a CDN for S3.
65. S3 supports signed cookies for access control.
66. Use IAM conditions to restrict object access.
67. S3 supports inventory encryption and delivery options.
68. Object tags can trigger lifecycle deletion.
69. S3 has request rate performance guidelines.
70. Use proper naming to partition objects effectively.
71. S3 integrates with AWS KMS for encryption audit logs.
72. S3 event notifications are at-least-once delivery.
73. S3 object checksum features verify data integrity.
74. Use multipart copy for large object copies.
75. S3 can replicate delete markers for versioned buckets.
76. S3 is often the source of ingestion pipelines.
77. S3 storage classes affect retrieval latency and cost.
78. Use access points for multi-tenant architectures.
79. S3 Object Lambda can filter sensitive fields.
80. S3 is foundational to many analytics and RAG workflows.
