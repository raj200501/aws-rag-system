Security and IAM Practices
1. IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.
2. Use least privilege for all IAM policies.
3. Prefer roles over long-lived access keys.
4. Use IAM roles for Lambda functions.
5. Use separate roles for different components.
6. Avoid wildcard permissions in production.
7. Use policy conditions to scope access.
8. Rotate access keys regularly if used.
9. Enable MFA for privileged users.
10. Use IAM Access Analyzer to detect public access.
11. Use AWS Organizations SCPs for guardrails.
12. Use separate AWS accounts for environments.
13. Use VPC endpoints to keep traffic private.
14. Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
15. Use KMS for encryption key management.
16. Restrict KMS key policies to required principals.
17. Enable CloudTrail in all accounts.
18. Centralize CloudTrail logs in a secure account.
19. Use AWS Config to monitor configuration drift.
20. Enable security hub for aggregated findings.
21. Use GuardDuty for threat detection.
22. Monitor IAM policy changes with alerts.
23. Use IAM roles with external IDs for cross-account access.
24. Use session policies for temporary restrictions.
25. Enforce tagging for resource ownership.
26. Use S3 Block Public Access on buckets.
27. Review bucket policies for public statements.
28. Use encryption for S3 buckets storing sensitive data.
29. Enable object lock for immutable storage.
30. Use KMS key rotation for compliance.
31. Use parameter store for secret configuration.
32. Avoid storing secrets in source control.
33. Use Secrets Manager for rotation of credentials.
34. Restrict Lambda network access to required subnets.
35. Use security groups to limit inbound/outbound traffic.
36. Use WAF for public endpoints.
37. Use API Gateway authorizers for authentication.
38. Implement rate limiting to reduce abuse.
39. Monitor failed authentication attempts.
40. Use CloudWatch alarms for access anomalies.
41. Use least privilege for CI/CD roles.
42. Rotate CI/CD tokens regularly.
43. Use separate roles for build and deploy.
44. Use IAM permissions boundaries for teams.
45. Use SSO for centralized access control.
46. Use service control policies for compliance.
47. Use resource policies for shared services.
48. Use encryption for RDS and DynamoDB.
49. Use TLS for all service endpoints.
50. Use private subnets for internal databases.
51. Use NAT gateways for outbound access if needed.
52. Use endpoint policies to restrict AWS service access.
53. Use logging for all security-relevant events.
54. Use VPC flow logs for network visibility.
55. Implement key management procedures.
56. Use secure coding practices for Lambda handlers.
57. Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.
58. Sanitize logs to avoid leaking secrets.
59. Apply patches and updates regularly.
60. Use vulnerability scanning for dependencies.
61. Use infrastructure as code for repeatability.
62. Review IAM policies periodically.
63. Use account-wide access analyzer reports.
64. Restrict root account usage.
65. Enable billing alerts for unexpected costs.
66. Use backups for critical data stores.
67. Use disaster recovery plans for resilience.
68. Conduct security reviews for new features.
69. Use change control processes in production.
70. Audit access to sensitive datasets.
71. Use data classification labels in metadata.
72. Implement data retention policies.
73. Monitor API usage for unusual patterns.
74. Use logging retention policies for compliance.
75. Use event-driven alerts for security events.
76. Use encryption context for fine-grained KMS controls.
77. Use IAM Access Advisor to review permissions.
78. Use role chaining sparingly to reduce complexity.
79. Use security testing in CI for infrastructure.
80. Security practices are foundational to RAG systems.
